# Useless Box

## Description
This is my first robotics project – a toy box that shuts itself off if you try to turn it on. Currently, it's missing two key features that I'd love to add. The first one is remote control via an infrared sensor, which is already implemented in the code, but I burned my IR sensor. Additionally, I'm unsure if the IR signals from the remote are universal, as I hardcoded them.

## Material List

### Electronics
- **Arduino Nano Ripoff** (from AliExpress)
- **Small Breadboard**
- **1 IR Arduino Sensor + Remote**
- **Resistances** (I don't remember the exact values, will update later)
- **USB-A to USB-C Cable**
- **Small Arduino Servo Motor**
- **1 Toggle Switch** (NOT UNIVERSAL, will include the link to my specific one)
- **Cables** to connect everything

### Miscellaneous
- **6 Zip Ties**
- **3D Printer Filament** (I used PLA for printed parts)
- **1.75mm PLA Filament** (for the hinges of the lids)

## Recommendations for 3D Printing Each Piece
- Use **PLA filament** for all printed parts to ensure durability.
- For hinges, use **1.75mm PLA filament**, as it provides the flexibility needed.
- If your printer supports it, consider printing at a lower resolution for non-critical parts to save time.

## Step-by-Step Guide
(Consider including a brief step-by-step guide here for those interested in building their own Useless Box.)

1. **Step 1: Assemble the Electronics**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to the breadboard.
   - Wire up the IR sensor and servo motor.
   - Ensure the toggle switch is properly wired.
   
2. **Step 2: Print the Parts**
   - Print the toy box's main body and lids using your 3D printer.
   - Print the hinges with flexible filament.

3. **Step 3: Final Assembly**
   - Attach the printed parts, ensuring that the lids close correctly.
   - Test the IR sensor and adjust the servo motor’s positioning.

4. **Step 4: Program the Arduino**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano to control the box’s functionality.
   - Test the box to see if it responds to the toggle switch.

## List of Links
(Links to all purchased materials)

- **Servo Motor**: [Link to AliExpress]
- **Arduino Nano Ripoff**: [Link to AliExpress]
- **IR Sensor + Remote**: [Link to AliExpress]
- **Toggle Switch**: [Link to AliExpress]

> **TODO**: Find a way to shorten the links since most of my materials came from AliExpress, and the URLs are long.

## Todo List

- [ ] Upload each part of the box
- [ ] Finalize material list (add missing resistor values)
- [ ] Shorten links to AliExpress materials

Structure of the readme
 - Title : Useless Box
 - Description: My first Robotics project about a toy box that shuts itself of if you try to turn it on,
   currently it is missing two features that I really like. The first one is remote control via infrared
   sensor which is already implemented via code but I burned my IR sensor and also i dont know if the ir
   signals of the remote are universal because I hardcoded them.
