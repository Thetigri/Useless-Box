Structure of the readme
 - Title : Useless Box
 - Description: My first Robotics project about a toy box that shuts itself of if you try to turn it on,
   currently it is missing two features that I really like. The first one is remote control via infrared
   sensor which is already implemented via code but I burned my IR sensor and also i dont know if the ir
   signals of the remote are universal because I hardcoded them.

 - Material list
 - Recomendations for 3D printing each piece
 - Step by step guide maybe?
 - List of Links
 
Todo list:
  -Upload each part of the box
  - Material list
     -Electronics
       - Arduino NANO ripoff from aliespress
       - Small breadboard
       - 1 IR arduino sensor + remote
       - Resistances (I DONT REMEMBER THE NUMBERS, COME BACK AND PUT THE OHMs)
       - USB-A to USB-C cable
       - Small arduino servo motor
       - 1 toggle switch (NOT UNIVERSAL, I will put the link to mine in with the links of all the other pieces)
       - Cables to connect everything
     -Miscelaneus
       - 6 Zip ties
       - 3D printer Filament (I used PLA) for the printed parts
       - 1.75mm filament (again PLA) for the hinges of the lids
  - Building tutorial maybe ??
  - List of links i bought materials from
